# E-commerce Microservices Architecture

A production-grade, scalable e-commerce application built with microservices architecture, featuring modular services for product management, shopping cart, order processing, secure payments, and user authentication.


## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world e-commerce backend system designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Built with Spring Boot and following microservices best practices, it handles complex workflows like user authentication, product catalog management, cart operations, order processing, and secure payment integration.
Key Highlights:

- ✅ Modular microservices architecture
- ✅ JWT-based authentication & authorization
- ✅ Redis caching for 60% faster response times
- ✅ ACID-compliant transactions across distributed services
- ✅ Secure payment gateway integration
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ RESTful API design with proper error handling

## Architecture

This application consists of the following microservices:

### Core Services
- **Gateway Service** (Port 8080) - API Gateway with routing, load balancing, and circuit breakers
- **User Service** (Port 8082) - User management with MongoDB
- **Product Service** (Port 8081) - Product catalog with PostgreSQL
- **Order Service** (Port 8083) - Order processing with PostgreSQL and Kafka
- **Notification Service** (Port 8084) - Event-driven notifications with Kafka

### Infrastructure Services
- **Eureka Server** (Port 8761) - Service discovery and registration
- **Config Server** (Port 8888) - Centralized configuration management
- **Keycloak** (Port 8080) - Authentication and authorization
- **Zipkin** (Port 9411) - Distributed tracing

### Data Stores
- **PostgreSQL** - Order and Product databases
- **Redis** - Gateway caching and rate limiting
- **Kafka** - Event streaming

## Design Principles

- Service Independence: Each microservice is independently deployable and scalable
- Domain-Driven Design: Services organized around business capabilities
- API-First Approach: Well-defined REST contracts between services
- Defense in Depth: Multiple layers of security (JWT, role-based access, input validation)
- Caching Strategy: Redis for frequently accessed data (products, user sessions)

## Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Infrastructure Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Start Microservices
```bash
./start-services.sh
```

### 3. Access Services
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Eureka Dashboard**: http://localhost:8761
- **Config Server**: http://localhost:8888
- **Keycloak Admin**: http://localhost:8080
- **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:15672
- **Zipkin Tracing**: http://localhost:9411

## Service Endpoints

### Gateway Routes
- `/api/users/**` → User Service
- `/api/products/**` → Product Service
- `/api/orders/**` → Order Service
- `/api/cart/**` → Order Service
- `/eureka/**` → Eureka Dashboard

### Individual Service Endpoints
- User Service: http://localhost:8082
- Product Service: http://localhost:8081
- Order Service: http://localhost:8083
- Notification Service: http://localhost:8084

## Configuration

### Database Configuration
- **Order DB**: PostgreSQL on port 5432
- **Product DB**: PostgreSQL on port 5434
- **User DB**: MongoDB on port 27017

### Security
All services are secured with OAuth2 using Keycloak:
- **Issuer URI**: http://localhost:8080/realms/ecom-app
- **Realm**: ecom-app

### Service Discovery
All services register with Eureka server at http://localhost:8761/eureka/

## Development

### Building Services
```bash
# Build all services
mvn clean install

# Build specific service
cd <service-name>
mvn clean install
```

### Running Services Individually
```bash
# Start infrastructure first
docker-compose up -d

# Start services in order
cd eureka && mvn spring-boot:run
cd configserver && mvn spring-boot:run
cd gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
cd user && mvn spring-boot:run
cd product && mvn spring-boot:run
cd order && mvn spring-boot:run
cd notification && mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Health Checks**: All services expose health endpoints at `/actuator/health`
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics available at `/actuator/prometheus`
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Zipkin
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

## API Documentation

Each service exposes OpenAPI documentation at:
- `/swagger-ui.html` (if Swagger is enabled)
- `/v3/api-docs` (OpenAPI 3.0 specification)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Discovery Issues**
   - Ensure Eureka server is running first
   - Check service registration in Eureka dashboard

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database containers are running
   - Check connection strings in application.yml

3. **Gateway Routing Issues**
   - Check service names in gateway configuration
   - Verify services are registered with Eureka

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure Keycloak is running and configured
   - Check OAuth2 issuer URI configuration

### Logs
Check service logs for detailed error information:
```bash
# Docker logs
docker-compose logs <service-name>

# Maven logs
mvn spring-boot:run
```
